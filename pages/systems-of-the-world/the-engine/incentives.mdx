# Incentives

We think people are "good" or "bad." We say, "He is a lazy worker," or "She is a greedy boss." We blame their soul.

People are not good or bad; they are rational. **They follow the cheese.** If you pay a doctor to perform surgery, you will get more surgery. If you pay people to sit at home, they will sit at home. If you build a bad maze, don't blame the rat for getting lost.

Stop blaming the player and start fixing the game. Look at the treat at the end of the maze. If you want different behavior, move the cheese.
