# Incentives

"Why did he do that? Is he crazy? Is he stupid?" We judge people when they do things we don't like.

People are not crazy. They are just following the points. "Show me the incentive, and I will show you the outcome." If you pay a doctor for every surgery, they will find reasons to do surgery. If you pay a recruiter for resumes, they will send trash.

We need to stop judging the person. We should look at the scorecard. We need to ask: "How are they paid? What gets them fired?" Usually, we find they are doing exactly what the system tells them to do.
