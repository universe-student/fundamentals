# Value & Pressure

We want to make money. We ask, "How can I get rich?" We focus on what *we* want to take from the world.

Money is not a thing you "make"; it is a certificate of performance. **Money flows like water from low pressure to high pressure.** It flows to where the value is created. You cannot catch the water; you must dig the hole. If you chase the money without the value, you will die thirsty.

Stop chasing the dollar. Chase the problem. Solve a painful problem for a rich person, and the money appears as a side effect.
