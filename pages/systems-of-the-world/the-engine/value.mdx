# Value & Pressure

We think: "I worked 8 hours, so I should get paid for 8 hours." We think effort equals money.

The world does not pay for effort. It pays for **Answers**. Money flows to the people who solve hard problems.
*   Low Pay: "I do what I am told." (Low Stress)
*   High Pay: "I decide what to do, and if I am wrong, it is my fault." (High Stress)

We need to stop looking for more hours. We should look for scarier problems. We must build our ability to handle stress. The person who can stay calm in a burning building is the most valuable person in town.
