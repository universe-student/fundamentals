# Compounding

We try hard for a week. Nothing happens. We go to the gym for a month. No muscles. We think, "This isn't working," and we quit.

Growth is not a straight line. It is a curve. It is like bamboo. For five years, you see nothing. Then, in six weeks, it grows 90 feet. This is the **Valley of Disappointment**.

We should expect the boring days. We need to know that small things—saving $10, reading 5 pages, being kind—add up. We shouldn't quit in the valley. We must wait for the curve.
