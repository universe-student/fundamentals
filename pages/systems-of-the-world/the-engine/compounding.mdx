# Compounding

We want the big win. We want the lottery ticket. We think success is a single event—a "big break."

**Rome was not built in a day, but it burned in one.** Real power comes from the slow, boring addition of 1% every day. The snowball looks pathetic at the top of the hill, but it is an avalanche at the bottom.

Stop looking for the shortcut. Fall in love with the boredom. Keep adding the penny, knowing that the explosion happens at the end, not the start.
