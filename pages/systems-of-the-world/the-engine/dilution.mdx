# Dilution

We are told to work hard, save our paper, and wait for retirement. We think the numbers in our bank account are a safe store of our life's energy. We trust the vault.

But the house is on fire. **Printing more money is just pouring water into the milk.** Every time a new bill is created out of thin air, the bills in your pocket lose their power. They aren't taking your money; they are stealing your *time*. If they double the money, they have effectively cut your life's work in half without you ever noticing.

Don't store your life in a leaky bucket. Stop hoarding paper. Own real things—land, skills, and assets that cannot be printed. If you save the "milk," make sure nobody is watering it down behind your back.
