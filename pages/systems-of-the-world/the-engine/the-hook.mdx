# The Hook

It feels like a win when we get a "free" check from the system. We think the government is finally "helping" us. We treat the handout like a gift from a friend.

There is no such thing as a free meal; there is only bait. **A bird that is fed every day eventually forgets how to fly.** If you depend on a giant machine for your bread, the machine owns your soul. The moment you disagree with the owner, the bread disappears. Dependency is just slavery with a nicer name.

Build your own engine. Refuse the easy bait. If you cannot survive without their "permission," you are not a citizen; you are cattle. Guard your independence like your life depends on it—because it does.
