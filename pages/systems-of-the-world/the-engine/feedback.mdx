# Feedback

We hate being told we are wrong. We build a fortress to keep the critics out. We want to be right, not better.

A system without feedback crashes. **Pain is data.** The customer's complaint is not an insult; it is a map. It tells you exactly where the hole in your boat is.

Lower the bridge. Invite the arrows. Say "Thank you" to the critic, because they are doing the work of finding your blind spots for free.
