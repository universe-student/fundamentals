# Trade-offs

We want it all. The six-pack and the donuts. The CEO salary and the naps. We think we can hack the system.

**There is no free lunch.** Every choice is a death; when you choose the road left, you kill the road right. You cannot have the view from the summit without the climb.

Stop dreaming of the perfect life. Choose your pain. Ask, "What am I willing to suffer for?" Pay the price at the door with a smile.
