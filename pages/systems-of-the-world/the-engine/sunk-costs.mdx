# Sunk Costs

We keep eating the burnt pizza because we paid for it. We stay in the miserable relationship because we "put in 5 years." We think we are saving our investment.

The money is dead. The years are ash. **Eating the trash does not bring the money back; it just turns your stomach into a garbage can.** You cannot save the past. If you stay because you "already paid," you are paying twice.

Walk away. Make decisions for *today*, not yesterday. Be brave enough to say, "I made a mistake," and cut the cord before it strangles you.
