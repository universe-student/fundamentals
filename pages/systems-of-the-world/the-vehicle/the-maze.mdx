# The Maze

We think the laws are there to protect us. We assume that if we just follow the rules, we will be safe. We believe that complexity is a sign of "progress."

The law is not a shield; it is a maze. **They make the rules so complex that it is impossible to be "innocent."** Everyone is a criminal; the only difference is who they decide to catch today. Complexity is a tax on the poor. If you need a team of experts just to understand your own rights, you don't have rights—you have a subscription to a lawyer.

Simplify your life. Don't play the game in the deep grass. Stay out of the maze. The more paper they pile up, the more they intend to bury you under it.
