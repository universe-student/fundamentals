# Margins

We pack our lives to the brim. Back-to-back meetings. Zero savings. We optimize for the perfect day.

**The perfect day never happens.** Life is bumpy. If you drive 100mph bumper-to-bumper, one tap on the brakes causes a ten-car pileup. Efficiency is fragile. If you have no margin, one bad day destroys you.

Leave a gap. Create a buffer of time and money. Build the shock absorbers so that when life hits a pothole, you don't crash; you just bounce.
