# Noise

We drink information like water. We check the news, the feed, and the email 50 times a day. We think we are staying informed.

**Most news is just mental junk food.** It makes us fat and anxious. If you listen to every station at once, you hear nothing but static. You are drowning in data but starving for wisdom. If you don't filter the input, your brain turns to mush.

Cut the cord. Choose quality over quantity. Realize that if it's important, it will find you. Turn down the volume of the world to hear the signal.
