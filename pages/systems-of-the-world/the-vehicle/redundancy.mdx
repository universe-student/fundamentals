# Redundancy

We want to be efficient. We hate waste. We want just enough money, just enough time, just enough staff.

But nature loves waste. You have two kidneys. You only need one. Why? Because if one fails, you don't die. **Efficiency is fragile.** If you have zero extra cash, one flat tire ruins your life.

We should keep a buffer. We need to save more than we think we need. We should learn extra skills. We must embrace a little "waste" today so we can survive a disaster tomorrow.
