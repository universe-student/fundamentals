# Redundancy

We want to be efficient. We carry exactly enough cash. We have exactly enough time. We think "extra" is a waste.

**One is the most dangerous number.** If you have one key, one client, or one engine, you are one mistake away from death. Nature gives us two kidneys for a reason. If the first one fails and you don't have a second, you die.

Waste resources on purpose. Keep a spare tire. Save money you don't need. Build a backup generator so that when the lights go out, you are the only house shining.
