# Hierarchy

We hate "the man." We think bosses are evil. We want everyone to be equal.

**If everyone is driving, the bus goes off the cliff.** Hierarchy is not about power; it is about speed. Someone has to pick the restaurant, or we all starve. If you refuse to follow, the team loses.

Respect the rank. If you are leading, lead. If you are following, follow. Play your position so the team can win.
