# Hierarchy

"Don't tell me what to do." We hate having a boss. It feels unfair.

Hierarchy is not about power. It is about **Speed**. If 100 people have to agree on where to go for lunch, they will starve. Someone has to decide. We trade accuracy for speed.

We need to respect the role, not the person. If we are leading, we should decide. If we are following, we should execute. We must play our position so the whole team can move fast.
