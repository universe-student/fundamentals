# Bottlenecks

We think the answer is "work harder." When the project stalls, we add more hours. When the car won't move, we rev the engine.

**Pushing a blocked pipe just bursts the pipe.** If the door is locked, running at it harder just breaks your shoulder. The output is limited by the tightest point.

Stop running. Find the knot. Spend 90% of your energy fixing the one thing that is slowing everything else down.
