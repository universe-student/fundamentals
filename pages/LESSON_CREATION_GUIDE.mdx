# The Dojo: Lesson Creation Masterclass

Welcome to the **Elementary School of the Universe**.
We do not write "blog posts." We do not write "essays."
We write **Code for the Human Operating System.**

Our goal is not to inform the student; it is to **wake them up.**

---

## 1. The Philosophy: Ruthless Love
We are not here to be the student's friend. We are here to be their sensei.
*   **Friends** tell you what you *want* to hear ("It's okay, take your time").
*   **Reality** tells you what you *need* to hear ("Adapt or die").

We speak with the voice of Reality. We are calm, we are absolute, and we are terrifyingly honest. We do not use "hedge words" like *maybe*, *perhaps*, or *try*. We use absolute truths.

## 2. The Anatomy of a Lesson (The Arc)
Every lesson follows a specific narrative arc designed to break a bad habit and install a new one.

### Part 1: The Lie (The Trap)
*   **Goal:** Expose the delusion.
*   **Method:** Describe the common behavior *exactly* as the student does it. Make them nod and say, "Damn, that is me."
*   **The Voice:** Empathetic ("We"). We share the struggle.
*   **Bad Example:** "People often waste time." (Boring)
*   **Good Example:** "We try to hoard time like gold. We rush to 'save' minutes." (Specific)

### Part 2: The Slap (The Reality)
*   **Goal:** Shock the system.
*   **Method:** Use a **Visceral Metaphor** and state the **Consequence**.
*   **The Consequence:** You MUST tell them the price they pay for ignoring the law. If there is no punishment, there is no urgency.
*   **The Voice:** Absolute ("Nature/Reality").
*   **Bad Example:** "Time management is important because life is short."
*   **Good Example:** "Time is fire. It burns whether you use it or not. If you treat today like a waiting room, you will die without ever having lived."

### Part 3: The Move (The Command)
*   **Goal:** Immediate action.
*   **Method:** Give a direct, imperative order. No fluff. No "we should."
*   **The Voice:** Commanding ("You").
*   **Bad Example:** "So, we should try to be more present."
*   **Good Example:** "Stop running. Inhabit the moment."

## 3. The Style Mechanics

### A. Visceral Metaphors
Abstract words are weak. Physical words are strong.
*   *Weak:* "Anxiety," "Growth," "Dignity."
*   *Strong:* "Fire," "Anchor," "Knife," "Rust," "Blood."
*   *Rule:* If you can't touch it, don't use it.

### B. The Binary Choice
Force the reader to choose. There is no middle ground.
*   "You are either a predator or prey."
*   "You are either growing or dying."
*   "You are the driver or the cargo."

### C. Kill the Robot
Never start sentences with the same pattern (e.g., "We think... But... So...").
*   **Open with action:** "We scream when it rains."
*   **Open with a quote:** "'I am a lawyer,' we say."
*   **Open with a question:** "Why is it so hard to start?"

### D. Theological Neutrality (The Design, Not the Designer)
We never take a side in the God vs. Evolution debate. We describe the **Mechanism**, not the **Maker**.
*   **No:** "Nature gave us kidneys." (Implies Nature is God).
*   **No:** "God designed us to sleep." (Implies Religion).
*   **Yes:** "The body requires sleep." / "You have two kidneys for a reason." (Fact).
*   *Rule:* Focus on *how it works*, not *who made it*.

## 4. The Checklist
Before you commit, ask:
1.  **Is it simple?** Could a 12-year-old understand it?
2.  **Is there a Slap?** Did I state the specific punishment for failure?
3.  **Is there a Command?** did I use "You" in the final paragraph?
4.  **Is it visceral?** Did I use physical objects instead of abstract concepts?
5.  **Is it neutral?** Did I avoid attributing creation to "Nature" or "God"?
