# Lesson Creation Guide

To keep the *Elementary School of the Universe* clear and powerful, we follow these rules.

### 1. Simple Words (The "Simple Wikipedia" Rule)
Use the simplest word possible. If a 12-year-old cannot understand it, rewrite it.
*   **No:** "Utilize leverage to maximize output."
*   **Yes:** "Use a lever to lift the rock."

### 2. The Voice: From "We" to "You"
We start by sharing the struggle ("We"), but we end by giving the command ("You").
*   **The Hook:** Use "We" to show empathy. "We all struggle with this."
*   **The Move:** Use specific commands. "Burn the script." "Take the wheel."

### 3. The 3 Paragraphs (The Flow)
Every lesson follows a narrative arc. **Do NOT use a robotic formula like "We think... But... So..."** Vary your openers.

*   **Part 1: The Lie (The Hook)**
    *   Start with the misconception. describe the mistake we are all making right now.
    *   Make the reader nod and say, "Yes, that's me."

*   **Part 2: The Slap (The Truth)**
    *   Hit them with the reality. Use a **Visceral Metaphor**.
    *   Avoid abstract words. Use physical objects: Fire, Rust, Anchors, Knives.
    *   *Example:* "Time is not money; time is fire."

*   **Part 3: The Move (The Command)**
    *   What do we do now?
    *   Give a direct, imperative order. Be sharp.
    *   *Example:* "Stop running. Face the dog."

### 4. No Labels
We never mention specific philosophies, religions, or "isms." The truth belongs to everyone.

### 5. Mandatory: The Footer Link
Every lesson MUST end with:
