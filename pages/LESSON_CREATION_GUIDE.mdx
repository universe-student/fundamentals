# Lesson Creation Guide

To keep the *Elementary School of the Universe* clear and powerful, we follow these rules.

### 1. Simple Words (The "Simple Wikipedia" Rule)
We use the simplest word possible. If a 12-year-old cannot understand it, we rewrite it.
*   **No:** "We must utilize leverage to maximize output."
*   **Yes:** "We use levers to do more with less."
*   **Why:** Big words create distance. Small words create connection.

### 2. Humble Charisma
We are not gurus on a mountain. We are students in the library.
*   **Humble:** We admit that we struggle too. We use "We" and "Us."
*   **Charismatic:** We speak with quiet confidence. We don't shout; we explain.

### 3. No Labels, No "Isms"
We never mention or cite specific philosophies, religions, or "isms."
*   **Take the Wisdom:** We take the good parts and write them as our own shared rules.
*   **No Criticism:** We never criticize or attack any philosophy or group. We stay neutral.
*   **Why:** Labels divide people. Truth belongs to everyone.

### 4. The Invisible Flow (The 3 Paragraphs)
Every lesson has three distinct parts, but **we do not label them**.

*   **Part 1 (The Feeling):** Start with the struggle. "We often feel..."
*   **Part 2 (The Truth):** Introduce the concept. "But nature tells us..."
*   **Part 3 (The Move):** The practical application. Use the "should" bridge here (e.g., "So, we should...").

### 5. The Soft Punch
Every lesson needs a moment of realization—an "Aha!" moment.
*   **Soft Punch:** "We often think we are tired, but really, we are just bored."

### 6. Mandatory: The Footer Link
We have removed the automatic sidebar link. Therefore, **every single lesson MUST end with this component.**

At the top of the file:
```mdx
import EditLink from '../../components/EditLink'
```

At the very bottom of the file (after the text):
```mdx
<EditLink />
```

*Note: Check your folder depth to adjust the import path (`../../` or `../../../`).*
