# Responsibility

We love to blame. "It's the economy." "It's my parents." "It's the traffic." We wrap ourselves in the warm blanket of victimhood.

**If you are not the driver, you are the cargo.** Blaming others feels good, but it makes you powerless. Even if the crash wasn't your fault, the car is yours to fix. If you wait for them to save you, you will die waiting.

Take the wheel. Own the mess. Say, "I am here because of me, and only I can get me out."
