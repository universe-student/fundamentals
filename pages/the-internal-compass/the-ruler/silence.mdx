# Silence

We are afraid of being bored. We fill every second with music, podcasts, or scrolling. Silence feels empty.

But we are drowning in noise. Wisdom does not shout. It whispers. If we never stop listening to others, we can never hear ourselves. Great ideas happen in the shower because it is the only time we shut up.

We should turn it off. We need to take a walk without headphones. We must sit in a room without a phone. We should let the mud settle so the water can become clear.
