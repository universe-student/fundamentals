# Silence

We are terrified of the quiet. We plug our ears with podcasts, music, and calls. We treat silence like a ghost we must banish.

**Noise is the drug we use to drown out our own soul.** We are afraid that if we stop the noise, we might hear something we don't like. Great ideas do not come from a shouting match; they come from the whisper in the shower. If you never shut up, you will never hear the truth.

Unplug. Walk without the headphones. Sit in the empty room. Let the mud settle until the water is clear enough to see the bottom.
