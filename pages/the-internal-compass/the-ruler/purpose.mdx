# Purpose

We wander. We take the job for the money. We float from weekend to weekend. We ask, "Is this it?"

**A man with a 'why' can bear any 'how'.** Laying bricks is torture; building a cathedral is joy. The pain is the same, but the meaning changes everything.

Find the cathedral. Stop asking "What pays the most?" and start asking "What matters the most?" Align the compass before you start the engine.
