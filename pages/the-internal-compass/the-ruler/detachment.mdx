# Detachment

We grip the steering wheel until our knuckles are white. We stress about the outcome. We tie our happiness to the trophy.

**You control the arrow, not the target.** A gust of wind can ruin the perfect shot. If you only love the bullseye, you will always be anxious. If you attach your soul to the result, you become a slave to luck.

Let go. Fall in love with the pulling of the string. Do the work perfectly, and then turn your back on the result. Trust the flight.
