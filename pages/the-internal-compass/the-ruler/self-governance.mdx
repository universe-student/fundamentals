# Self-Governance

"I'm just not motivated today." We wait for the feeling of excitement to hit us before we start working.

But motivation is a feeling. Discipline is a machine. Feelings change with the weather. Machines run rain or shine. If we only work when we feel good, we will lose to the person who works when they feel bad.

We need to stop asking "Do I want to do this?" We should start asking "What does the job require?" We must build a machine that runs even when we are tired.
