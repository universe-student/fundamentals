# Self-Governance

We wait for "motivation." We check the weather of our mood to see if we can work. We are slaves to our feelings.

**Feelings are fickle children.** If you let the toddler drive the car, you will crash. Motivation is not a strategy; it is a bonus. The professional works when they feel sick, sad, or tired. If you only work when you are happy, you will never build anything great.

Fire the toddler. Build a machine. Do the work not because you want to, but because you said you would. Let discipline drive the bus.
