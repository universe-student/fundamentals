# Courage

We wait for the fear to leave. We think brave people are not afraid. We wait to feel "ready."

**Courage is not the absence of fear; it is acting while your hands are shaking.** The hero and the coward feel the exact same fear; only the hero moves forward. The fear is the fuel.

Invite the butterflies. Take the step while your stomach turns. Realize that the other side of fear is freedom.
