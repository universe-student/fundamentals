# Action

We love to plan. We read books, buy gear, and make lists. We feel productive. But we are just procrastinating in high definition.

**You cannot plow a field by turning it over in your mind.** The map is not the terrain. One step is worth a hundred hours of thinking. The universe does not reward intelligence; it rewards motion. If you stay on the dock, the ship leaves without you.

Stop preparing. Launch the imperfect ship. Fire the bullet and aim it while it is flying.
