# Action

"Why is this happening to me?" We hit a wall. A project fails. We get rejected. We feel like victims.

But the obstacle is not blocking the path. **The obstacle IS the path.** The gym feels heavy? Good, that makes you strong. The client is difficult? Good, that teaches you patience.

We shouldn't wish for easier lives. We should wish to be stronger people. We need to look at the problem and say: "Thank you for the lesson."
