# Integrity

"I'll do it tomorrow." "It's just a small lie." We make promises to ourselves and break them. We think it doesn't matter because nobody knows.

We know. Every time we break a promise to ourselves, we cut a hole in our confidence. "Imposter Syndrome" happens when we know we are faking it.

We need to close the gap. If we say we will exercise, we should exercise. If we say we will call, we must call. We should treat our word like a contract. When we trust ourselves, we are unbreakable.
