# Integrity

We tell "white lies." We break small promises. We think, "It's just a small thing, no one will know."

**You will know.** Every lie is a crack in your own spine. If you cannot trust your own word, you become weak. You cannot command the world if you cannot command your own tongue. If your word is garbage, your life is garbage.

Become rigid. Tell the truth even when it costs you money. Keep the promise even when it is raining. Build a spine of steel.
