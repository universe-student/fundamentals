# Patience

We dig up the seed to see if it's growing. We yell at the oven to cook faster. We think speed is the only virtue.

**Nature has a clock.** You cannot make a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant. Greatness takes time. The bamboo grows underground for five years before it shoots up.

Wait actively. Do the work today, and let the result come when it is ready. Trust the season.
