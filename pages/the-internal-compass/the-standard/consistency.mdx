# Consistency

We want the montage. We want to work hard for one week and look like a Greek god. We rely on intensity.

**Water cuts through rock not by force, but by persistence.** The Grand Canyon was not made by a hammer; it was made by a river that didn't stop. Intensity makes a splash; consistency makes an ocean. If you stop, you lose everything.

Show up. Do the boring work on the boring Tuesday. Don't try to be amazing; try to be inevitable.
