# The Story

We think memory is a video file. We swear, "That is exactly what happened." We fight to the death over our version of the past.

The brain is a liar. It is a storyteller that edits the film to make us look good. **We are always the hero or the victim in our own movie.** We delete the scenes where we were the villain.

Question the narrator. When you feel self-righteous, ask, "Is this true, or is this just the story that makes me feel safe?" Rewrite the script to be true, not just comfortable.
