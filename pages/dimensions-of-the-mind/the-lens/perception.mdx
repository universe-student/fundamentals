# Perception

We think we see the truth. "He gave me a dirty look." "This project is a disaster." We are sure of it.

But we don't see the world as it is; we see it as **we** are. Our eyes and brains are filters. We miss 99% of what is happening, and we color the rest with our mood.

We shouldn't trust our first reaction. We need to treat our view like a map, not the ground. We should ask others: "What do you see?" We must stay curious, not certain.
