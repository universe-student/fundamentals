# Perception

We think we see the world like a camera. We look out and say, "This is the truth." We trust our eyes.

The brain is not a camera; it is a projector. We don't see things as they are; **we see things as WE are.** A thief sees pockets; a saint sees smiles. The world is just a mirror reflecting our own mood back at us.

Wipe the lens. When the world looks ugly, check your own heart. Realize that the "bad day" is usually just a bad mood.
