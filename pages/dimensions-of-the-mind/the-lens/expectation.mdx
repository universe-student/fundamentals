# Expectation

We scream when it rains on our picnic. We get furious when the traffic is slow. We fight with reality because it didn't read our script.

The universe doesn't have a copy of your script. **You are not angry at the rain; you are angry at your hallucination.** You fell in love with a fantasy, and now you are mad that the real world showed up. If you fight reality, you will lose 100% of the time.

Burn the script. Look at what *is*, not what *should be*. Stop fighting the map and start walking the territory.
