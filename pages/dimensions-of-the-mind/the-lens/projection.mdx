# Projection

Some people just drive us crazy. We hate how arrogant they are. We can't stand how selfish they act.

But the brain is a projector. Often, the things we hate most in others are the things we don't like in ourselves. We spot "selfishness" quickly because we are worried about being selfish.

When we feel a strong trigger, we should look in the mirror. We need to ask: "Is this really about them? Or is this showing me something I need to fix in myself?"
