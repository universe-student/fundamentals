# Projection

We hate people who are rude, greedy, or fake. We point the finger and say, "Look at that terrible person." We feel superior.

We only recognize what we know. **You cannot see a trait in others unless you have it in yourself.** The things that annoy us the most are usually the shadows we are trying to hide. The finger points out, but the thumb points back.

Use the trigger. When someone makes you furious, ask, "Where does this live in me?" Use your enemies as mirrors to find your own dirt.
