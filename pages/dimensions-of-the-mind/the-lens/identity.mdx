# Identity

"I am a lawyer," we say. "I am a depressive." "I am a smoker." We glue these labels to our forehead. We think they are our skin.

Labels are just costumes. **We are the actor, not the character.** If you wear a mask for too long, the glue dries and you forget your own face. You become a prisoner of your own introduction. You will die defending a character that isn't even you.

Peel off the stickers. Hold your roles loosely. Be the consciousness behind the mask, ready to change the costume whenever the scene changes.
