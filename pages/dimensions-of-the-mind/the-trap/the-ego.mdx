# The Ego

When someone says our work is bad, it feels like a physical punch. Our heart races. We want to fight back.

This is the Ego. It is a guard dog. In the past, it protected us from tigers. Today, it tries to protect our "identity." It thinks a bad comment is a threat to our life.

We need to tell the guard dog to sit down. We are not our ideas. We are not our job titles. If someone attacks our idea, we shouldn't bleed. We should let a bad idea die so a good one can live.
