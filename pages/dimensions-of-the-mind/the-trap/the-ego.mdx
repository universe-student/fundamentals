# The Ego

We think we are protecting our dignity. We argue to be right. We hide our mistakes. We build a castle to protect the King.

The Ego is not a King; it is a sensitive child. **It is a fragile balloon that fears the smallest needle.** It spends all its energy building walls to protect a ghost. It keeps us lonely and stupid. If you protect your image, you starve your soul.

Pop the balloon. Laugh at yourself. Admit you are an idiot. When you have nothing to defend, you are finally free to learn.
