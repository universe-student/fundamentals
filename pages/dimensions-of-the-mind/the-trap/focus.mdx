# Focus

We think we can multitask. We text, drive, and listen to a podcast. We think we are juggling.

The brain cannot juggle; it can only toggle. It switches back and forth rapidly, losing IQ points with every switch. **Multitasking is just doing two things badly.** A scattered light lights nothing; a focused laser cuts steel.

Protect the beam. Do one thing. Close the tabs. Turn the phone off. Commit to the single point until it burns through.
