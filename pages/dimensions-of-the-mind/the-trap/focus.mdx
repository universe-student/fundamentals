# Focus

We feel busy. We have ten tabs open. We are answering emails while on a call. We think we are being productive.

But the brain cannot multitask. It just switches very fast, and it loses power every time it switches. Attention is like money. If we spend pennies everywhere, we buy nothing. If we save it up, we can buy something huge.

We need to choose. We should say "no" to good things so we can say "yes" to one great thing. We must close the tabs. We should put the phone away. We need to give one thing our full power.
