# The Screen

We watch the news and feel a surge of rage. We argue with our neighbors over the "scandal" of the week. We think we are "staying informed" and participating in a great debate.

The news is not information; it is a puppet show. **While you are screaming at the puppet on the left, the hand on the right is in your pocket.** They use fear and hate to keep the tribe divided. A house that is fighting itself is easy to rob. If you are angry at someone you've never met, you are being played like an instrument.

Turn off the screen. Look at your neighbor's face, not their "side." Stop fighting the puppets and start looking for the strings. The truth is never found in the shouting.
