# The Shadow

We have dark thoughts. We feel jealous, cruel, or weak. We think, "That's not me." We lock the monster in the basement.

**A monster in the dark grows 10 feet tall.** What you resist, persists. The shadow controls you from the dark. The priest who suppresses his lust becomes the predator. The nice guy who suppresses his anger becomes the psycho. If you bury your demons, they will dig themselves out and eat you.

Turn on the lights. Invite the monster to tea. Say, "I see you." When you look the shadow in the eye, it shrinks back into a manageable part of you.
