# Envy

We look at the neighbor's car and feel sick. We scroll through Instagram and feel like failures. We want their life.

**Envy is drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.** We see their highlight reel, not their bloopers. We don't see the debt, the stress, or the tears. We want the prize without the price.

Keep your eyes on your own paper. Realize that their win does not mean your loss. Stop watching the scoreboard and start playing the game.
