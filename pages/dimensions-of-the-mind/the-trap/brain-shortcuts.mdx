# Brain Shortcuts

We trust our gut. We feel like we are rational people making logical choices.

But our brains are lazy. They use shortcuts to save energy. We only read news that agrees with us. We are more afraid of losing $10 than happy about winning $10.

We should install a "Pause Button." When we feel totally sure we are right, we need to stop. We should assume we might be hacked by our own brain. We need to look for one fact that proves us wrong.
