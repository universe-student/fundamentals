# Brain Shortcuts

We think we are logical. We think we make decisions based on facts and data. We trust our gut.

The brain is lazy. It uses shortcuts to save energy. It assumes "expensive = good" or "tall = leader." **We are running software from the Stone Age in a digital world.** Our "gut" is often just an ancient glitch.

Pause the program. Assume your first thought is wrong. Slow down and force the brain to do the math. Drive the car manually.
