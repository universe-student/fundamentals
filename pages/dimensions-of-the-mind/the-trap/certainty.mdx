# Certainty

We are terrified to say "I don't know." We fake it. We pick a side and defend it to the death. We think doubt is weakness.

**Certainty is the coffin of intelligence.** If you already know the answer, you stop looking. You become a stone. A flexible mind is a living mind; a rigid mind is dead.

Love the question mark. Embrace the "I don't know." Stay curious, because the moment you are certain, you are finished.
