# Forgiveness

We hold the grudge like a shield. We replay the betrayal. We think, "I will hate them until they suffer."

**A grudge is a hot coal you hold in your hand.** You are the one burning. The other person is out dancing while you sit in your room drinking poison.

Drop the rock. Don't forgive for them; forgive to heal your own hand. Evict them from your head because the rent is too high.
