# The Game of Life

We think that to win, someone else has to lose. "If I get the job, you don't." "If I get the pizza, you starve."

This is a **Zero-Sum Game**. It is how sports work, but it is not how life works. Life is a **Positive-Sum Game**. We can build a bigger pizza. We can start a company together and both get rich.

We need to stop fighting for scraps. We should look for partners. We should ask: "How can we both win?" When we play this way, people want to play with us. And in life, the person with the most friends wins.
