# The Game of Life

We think life is a solo sprint. We try to grab the most toys. We think the winner is the one with the biggest pile.

Life is an **Iterated Game.** We play with the same people over and over again. If you screw someone today, they will block you tomorrow. The lone wolf starves; the pack survives. If you win every battle, you will lose the war because no one will play with you.

Play for the long haul. Don't try to win the round; try to keep the game going. Leave money on the table so others can eat too.
