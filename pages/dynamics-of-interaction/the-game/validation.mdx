# Validation

We perform for the crowd. We post the photo, tell the joke, and check the likes. We are addicted to the clapping.

**If you live for their applause, you will die by their silence.** You are a puppet, and they hold the strings. You have handed the remote control of your soul to strangers. If they stop clapping, you disappear.

Cut the strings. Become your own audience. Look in the mirror and clap for yourself. Do the work because it is good, not because they are watching.
