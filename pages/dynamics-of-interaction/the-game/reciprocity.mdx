# Reciprocity

We take and take. We think we are clever when we get something for free. We count our pennies.

The universe keeps a ledger. **If you take without giving, you create a debt.** People feel it. They will shut the door. Generosity is not charity; it is the best investment strategy in the world.

Give first. Pour value into the bucket before you try to drink from it. Act like a fountain, not a drain.
