# Reciprocity

We want things. We want help. We want attention. We ask the world: "Can you help me?"

But humans are wired to trade. If you scratch my back, I want to scratch yours. It is an instinct deep in our DNA. You cannot withdraw from a bank account you haven't deposited into.

We need to go first. We should give help before we ask for it. We must offer value before we send an invoice. When we give first, we create a debt of gratitude. The world will naturally want to pay us back.
