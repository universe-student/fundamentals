# Reputation

We think we can cheat "just this once." We think no one is watching. We cut a corner to save a dollar.

**Reputation is glass.** It takes ten years to build and ten seconds to shatter. You can glue it back together, but the cracks will always show. In a connected world, your name is the only currency that matters.

Act as if the lights are always on. Keep the promise even when it hurts. Protect your name with your life.
