# The Architecture of Trust

We want to be nice. If a friend has spinach in their teeth, we don't say anything because we don't want to embarrass them. If a coworker is failing, we stay quiet.

This is not kindness. It is fear. We are afraid of being awkward. But by saying nothing, we let our friend look silly. We let our team fail. Trust is built on truth.

We should use Radical Candor. We need to show we care ("I want you to look your best"). Then we must say the truth ("You have spinach in your teeth"). Real friends tell you the truth, even when it hurts.
