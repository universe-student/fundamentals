# Communication

We want to be nice. We see spinach in our friend's teeth, and we say nothing. We see a coworker failing, and we stay silent. We think this is kindness.

This is not kindness; it is cowardice. **We are prioritizing our own comfort over their success.** By staying silent, we let them look like fools. Truth is the only real form of love. If you don't tell them, you are letting them walk off a cliff.

Choose the hard conversation. Say the thing that makes your hands shake. Care enough to be awkward.
