# Tribes

We love our team. We hate their team. We think "we" are the good guys and "they" are the monsters. We love the flag more than the truth.

This is just monkey software. **We are programmed to kill the outsider.** When we label someone "The Enemy," we turn off our brain. We stop seeing a human; we see a target.

Drop the flag. Refuse to be part of the mob. Judge the man, not the uniform. Find wisdom in the enemy camp.
