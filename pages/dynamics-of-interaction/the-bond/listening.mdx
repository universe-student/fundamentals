# Listening

We stay quiet to be polite. But inside, we are reloading. We are planning our next sentence. We are just waiting for a gap in the noise to shoot our opinion.

**Reloading is not listening.** If your cup is full of your own thoughts, you cannot receive anything. You learn nothing when your mouth is open (or when your mind is shouting). If you don't listen, you are just a radio broadcasting to an empty room.

Empty the cup. Kill the internal radio. Listen not to reply, but to understand. Give the rarest gift: true attention.
