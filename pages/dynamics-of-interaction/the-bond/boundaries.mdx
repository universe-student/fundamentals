# Boundaries

We say "yes" because we want to be liked. We let people walk all over us. We think a "nice" person has an open door.

A house without walls is not a home; it is a sidewalk. **If you don't have a fence, you don't have a yard.** If you let everyone in, you are not a saint; you are a doormat. You cannot protect your peace if you don't lock the gate.

Build the wall. Say "no" without apology. Teach people how to treat you. Realize that the only people who get angry at boundaries are the ones who benefited from you having none.
