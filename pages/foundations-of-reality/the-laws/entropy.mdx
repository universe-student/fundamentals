# Entropy

Everyone thinks that if we build something good, it will stay good forever. We assume the relationship, the house, or the body is a "finished project."

The universe is actually a relentless shredder. It does not pause. **Chaos is the default setting.** A garden does not weed itself; it strangles itself. If you leave a car in a field, it doesn't stay a car; it becomes rust.

Be the **Anti-Chaos Machine.** Don't just "maintain" things; fight a daily war against decay. If you stop pushing the rock up the hill, it doesn't stay still—it rolls over you.
