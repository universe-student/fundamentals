# Entropy

Everyone thinks that if we build something good, it will stay good forever. We assume the relationship, the house, or the body is a "finished project."

The universe is actually a relentless shredder. It does not pause. **Chaos is the default setting.** A garden does not weed itself; it strangles itself. If you stop pushing the rock up the hill, it doesn't just stay still—**it rolls back down and crushes you.**

Be the **Anti-Chaos Machine.** Don't just "maintain" things; fight a daily war against decay. Pushing is the only thing keeping the roof from collapsing on your head.
