# Entropy

It feels unfair. If we take a break from the gym, we lose muscle. If we ignore the garden, weeds grow. Why can't things just stay good?

The universe has a rule: **Order naturally turns into chaos.** This is called Entropy. A house does not clean itself. A relationship does not fix itself. Left alone, everything falls apart. Decay is the default setting of the universe.

We shouldn't take it personally. Instead, we should realize that our job is to be the **Anti-Chaos Machine**. Every day, we must inject a little bit of energy into the things we love. We should call a friend. We should write the code. We should tidy the desk. We are the only force keeping the chaos away.
