# Paradox

We want the truth to be clean. We want the answer to be A or B. We ask, "Should I be humble or confident?" "Should I rest or grind?"

The truth is usually a messy soup. **Life is not black and white; it is grey fire.** If you pick only one side, you become rigid. A rigid bridge breaks in the wind. If you are only humble, you get stepped on. If you are only arrogant, you get blinded.

Stop trying to balance the scale. Ride the seesaw. Hold two opposing truths in your head and refuse to go crazy. Live in the tension.
