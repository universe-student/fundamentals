# Paradox

We want the truth to be clean. We want the answer to be A or B. We ask, "Should I be humble or confident?" "Should I rest or grind?"

The truth is usually a messy soup. **Life is not black and white; it is grey fire.** We must be humble enough to learn *and* arrogant enough to start. We must be content with today *and* hungry for tomorrow.

Stop trying to balance the scale. Ride the seesaw. Hold two opposing truths in your head and refuse to go crazy. Live in the tension.
