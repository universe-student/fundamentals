# Leverage

It feels like to get double the result, we need double the effort. We grind, we sweat, and we add more hours to the clock. We try to move the boulder by pushing it with our bare hands.

Brute force is for amateurs. **A small child with a crowbar can lift more than a giant with bare hands.** If you rely only on your own sweat, you will always be tired, and you will always be poor. The universe does not reward the hardest worker; it rewards the smartest tool.

Stop pushing and start positioning. Find the fulcrum. Use code, media, and capital. Don't ask "How can I work harder?" Ask "Where can I touch this system to make it move itself?"
