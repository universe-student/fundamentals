# Leverage

We work hard. We work long hours. But sometimes, we look at others who seem to do less but achieve more. It feels like cheating.

They are not stronger than us. They are just using a longer lever. If you try to lift a car with your hands, you will fail. If you use a jack, it is easy.

We have limited time. We cannot just "work harder" forever. We need tools that multiply our effort. Code is a lever. Money is a lever. Media is a lever. When the rock is too heavy, we shouldn't strain our backs. We should step back and look for a tool.
