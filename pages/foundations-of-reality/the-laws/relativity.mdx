# Relativity

We cry because our house is small, while a man in a tent prays for a roof. We look at our problems and think they are "huge," then look at our victories and think they are "tiny."

Big and small are ghosts. They do not exist in the real world. A mountain is only big because you are standing at the bottom. **To an ant, a pebble is Everest.** If you keep comparing yourself to the lucky, you are choosing to be miserable. You are locking yourself in a cage of your own making.

Destroy the scale. Compare yourself to the dead, and you will feel rich. You choose the ruler, so you choose the suffering.
