# Relativity

We cry because our house is small, while a man in a tent prays for a roof. We look at our problems and think they are "huge," then look at our victories and think they are "tiny."

Big and small are ghosts. They do not exist in the real world. A mountain is only big because you are standing at the bottom. **To an ant, a pebble is Everest.**

Destroy the scale. If you compare yourself to the lucky, you will feel cursed. If you compare yourself to the dead, you will feel blessed. You choose the ruler, so you choose the feeling.
