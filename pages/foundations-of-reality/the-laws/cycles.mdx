# Cycles

Most people treat life like a ladder. We think every year must be better than the last. When we stumble, or when the economy crashes, we panic. We think the sky is falling.

The sky is not falling; it is just turning. **History is a wheel, not a line.** Summer *always* dies into winter. If you expect constant growth, you will be crushed when the winter comes. You will be the grasshopper who freezes because he didn't believe the snow was real.

Don't panic in the winter. Sharpen your tools. Know that the bottom of the wheel inevitably becomes the top. Don't fight the season; dress for it.
