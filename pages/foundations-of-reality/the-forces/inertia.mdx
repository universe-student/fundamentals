# Inertia

We have all been there. The project is due, but we are staring at a blank screen. We want to work, but we feel "stuck." We often blame ourselves. We think we are lazy.

But physics tells us a different story. The law of Inertia says: **Things that are still want to stay still.** It is not a character flaw. It is a law of nature. A heavy rock will not move unless a force pushes it. The heaviest part of any task is not the middle—it is the very beginning. The energy needed to go from 0 to 1 is huge.

So, we should stop waiting to "feel like it." We need to accept that the start will be heavy. We must give ourselves a massive shove just to get the wheels turning. And once we are moving, we should protect our speed. We shouldn't stop, because we know how hard it is to start again.
