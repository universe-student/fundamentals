# Inertia

Why is it so hard to start? We stare at the blank page or the running shoes and feel a physical weight pushing us down. We think we are lazy.

We are not lazy; we are fighting physics. **A parked car wants to stay parked.** The universe hates change. The first step is not just a step; it is a declaration of war against the status quo.

Don't wait to "feel" like starting. Launch. Force the rocket off the ground with maximum thrust. Once you are moving, the same law that held you back will keep you pushing forward.
