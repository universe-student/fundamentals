# Space

We are terrified of emptiness. We fill every silence with noise, every shelf with junk, and every minute with scrolling. We think an empty cup is useless.

A cup is *only* useful because it is empty. **You cannot dance in a storage unit.** If our life is packed to the brim, there is no room for the new thing to enter. We are choking on our own fullness.

Become the vacuum. Throw things out. Sit in silence. Create the void so that the universe has a place to pour its magic.
