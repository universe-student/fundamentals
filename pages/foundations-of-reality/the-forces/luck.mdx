# Luck

We love to take credit for our wins. When we succeed, we are geniuses. When we fail, we are victims. We think we are the gods of our own story.

The universe is a casino. **Sometimes the idiot wins the jackpot, and the genius gets hit by a bus.** Randomness is a storm we cannot control. If you think you are in control, the storm will humble you.

Admit you are small. You cannot summon the wind, but you can build a massive sail. Work hard not to force the outcome, but to be the one standing there with a bucket when it finally rains diamonds.
