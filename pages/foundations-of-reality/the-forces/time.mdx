# Time

People try to hoard time like gold. We rush to "save" minutes. We treat our schedule like a bank account that we can fill up.

Time is not money; **time is fire.** It burns whether we use it or not. You cannot store a flame. When we rush, we don't save time; we just burn it faster and choke on the smoke.

Stop trying to manage the river and start managing the boat. You cannot stop the burning, but you can choose what you illuminate. Stop rushing and start inhabiting the moment.
