# Time

People try to hoard time like gold. We rush to "save" minutes. We treat our schedule like a bank account that we can fill up.

Time is not money; **time is fire.** It burns whether we use it or not. You cannot store a flame. When you rush, you don't save time; you just burn it faster. If you treat today like a waiting room for tomorrow, you will die without ever having lived.

Stop trying to manage the river and start managing the boat. You cannot stop the burning, but you can choose what you illuminate. Inhabit the moment.
