# Friction

We get angry when things don't go smoothly. The internet is slow. The line is long. The bureaucrat lost our form. We scream at the delay.

Friction is the only reason we can move. **On a perfectly smooth surface, we would slip and fall.** If you curse the friction, you are cursing the very thing that gives you traction. Without the rough road, you are just spinning your wheels in the mud.

Stop complaining. Dig your heels in. Use the difficulty to push off and propel yourself forward.
