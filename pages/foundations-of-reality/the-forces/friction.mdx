# Friction

Sometimes, it feels like we are walking through mud. A simple conversation turns into a fight. A quick task takes all day. We get frustrated. We try to push harder.

In physics, this is Friction. It happens whenever two things rub against each other. It turns our energy into heat. When we push harder against friction, we just create more heat. We get burnout. We get angry. But we don't move any faster.

We need to stop pushing. We should look for the "rub." Is the goal unclear? Are we tired? Is the tool broken? We don't need more strength. We need oil. We should smooth the path so the movement becomes easy.
