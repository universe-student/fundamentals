# Friction

We get angry when things don't go smoothly. The internet is slow. The line is long. The bureaucrat lost our form. We scream at the delay.

Friction is the only reason we can move. **On a perfectly smooth surface, we would slip and fall.** We need the rough patch to get a grip. The obstacle provides the traction.

Stop cursing the rough road. Dig your heels in. Use the difficulty to push off and propel yourself forward.
