# Gravity

It's common to complain that life is hard. We wish the weight would disappear. We want to float through our days without resistance.

**Without gravity, our bones dissolve.** An astronaut returns from space weak and fragile. The weight is not the enemy; the weight is the gym. We need the resistance to define our shape.

Don't pray for a lighter load. Pray for a stronger back. Thank the gravity for keeping you grounded and making you strong.
