# Gravity

We spend a lot of energy wishing things were different. We wish the market was easier. We wish our boss was nicer. We wish we had more time.

This is like wishing a rock wasn't heavy. Gravity is the force that pulls everything down. It doesn't care about our wishes. It is constant. Fighting gravity is exhausting. If we try to float, we will fall.

We should not fight the weight of the world; we should build with it. An architect uses the weight of the stone to hold the building together. We need to accept the "heavy" truths of our lives—our limits, our bills, our difficult people. We should stop arguing with reality and start building on top of it.
