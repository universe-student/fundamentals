# Elementary School of the Universe

**Welcome, Student.**

We have entered a permanent repository of universal basics.
There are no grades here. There is no graduation. We are here to study the "Source Code" of reality.

## The Philosophy
Most of us try to navigate life using **Opinions** ("I think this should work").
Here, we navigate using **Laws** ("This works because it has to").

We believe that the same rules that govern the motion of planets also govern the motion of our careers, our relationships, and our minds. When we understand the laws, the confusion disappears.

## The Stack

We have organized the curriculum from the bottom up—from the cold hard ground of reality to the highest levels of human ethics.

### 1. Foundations of Reality (The Rules of the Board)
Before we can play the game, we must understand the board. We study **Inertia** and **Friction** so we can understand why it is so hard for us to start a new habit.

### 2. Mechanics of Life (The Player)
Once we know the rules, we need to understand the machine we are operating. We study **Energy** and **Adaptation** to keep our engines running without burning out.

### 3. Dimensions of the Mind (The Operating System)
The hardware is biological, but the software is psychological. We study the **Ego** and **Focus** so we can fix the glitches in our own thinking.

### 4. Dynamics of Interaction (Multiplayer Mode)
We do not live alone. We study **Trust** and **Reciprocity** to win the games we play with the people around us.

### 5. Systems of the World (The Economy)
We live inside massive machines built by others. We study **Hierarchy** and **Money** so we can navigate the maze without getting lost.

### 6. The Internal Compass (The Strategy)
Finally, with all this power, where do we go? We study **Integrity** and **Action** to ensure we are climbing the right mountain.

## Where should we start?

We don't need to read this in order. **We should start where we bleed.**

*   **Do we feel stuck?** We go to [Foundations of Reality](/foundations-of-reality/the-forces/inertia).
*   **Do we feel burned out?** We go to [Mechanics of Life](/mechanics-of-life/balance/homeostasis).
*   **Are we angry at people?** We go to [Dimensions of the Mind](/dimensions-of-the-mind/the-lens/projection).
*   **Are we confused by our boss?** We go to [Systems of the World](/systems-of-the-world/the-engine/incentives).

Class is in session.
