# Elementary School of the Universe

**Welcome, Student.**

You have entered a permanent repository of universal basics.
There are no grades here. There is no graduation. You are here to study the "Source Code" of reality.


### The Philosophy
Most people try to navigate life using **Opinions** ("I hope this works"). They guess, and often, they miss.
Here, we navigate using **Laws** ("This works because it has to").

Gravity doesn't care if you are tired. It just pulls. The universe operates on clear, consistent rules. **When you fight the rules, you get tired. When you align with them, you get leverage.**

### No Gurus
We do not have professors here. We do not have masters.
We are all students in the same library.

If you see a mistake, fix it. If you know a sharper truth, share it.
This school belongs to the curious. Click **"Edit this page"** on any lesson to sharpen the knowledge.

### The Stack

We have organized the curriculum from the bottom up—from the cold hard ground of reality to the highest levels of human strategy.

#### 1. Foundations of Reality (The Board)
Before you can play the game, you must understand the board. You study **Inertia** and **Entropy** to understand why it takes energy to start, and why it takes effort to last.

#### 2. Mechanics of Life (The Player)
You are operating a biological machine. You study **Energy** and **Adaptation** to keep your engine running without burning out.

#### 3. Dimensions of the Mind (The Operating System)
The hardware is biological, but the software is psychological. You study the **Ego** and **The Story** to fix the glitches that make you miserable.

#### 4. Dynamics of Interaction (Multiplayer Mode)
You do not live alone. You study **Tribes** and **Reciprocity** to build the alliances you need to win.

#### 5. Systems of the World (The Engine)
You live inside massive machines built by others. You study **Incentives** and **Dilution** so you can navigate the maze without getting lost.

#### 6. The Internal Compass (The Strategy)
Finally, with all this power, where do you go? You study **Integrity** and **Purpose** because speed is useless if you are running in the wrong direction.
