# Rhythm

We try to be robots. We drink coffee to stay awake and pills to fall asleep. We want to be "on" all the time.

We are bags of water influenced by the moon. **We are waves, not straight lines.** We have high tides and low tides. Trying to be productive during a low tide is like trying to swim through sand.

Stop fighting the ocean. Surf. When the wave is high, ride it. When the wave is low, float. Honor the pulse.
