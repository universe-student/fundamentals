# Dormancy

When we are not producing, we feel guilty. If we aren't posting, shipping, or earning, we feel like we are failing. We are afraid of the quiet.

Look at a tree in winter. It looks dead. No leaves. No fruit. But it is not dead. It is **Dormant**. Deep underground, the roots are growing. It is gathering strength for the spring. Nature knows that you cannot have endless summer.

We should respect our own winters. When we feel the need to retreat, we shouldn't call it "lazy." We should call it recharging. We need to use the quiet time to grow our roots, so our next fruit will be even sweeter.
