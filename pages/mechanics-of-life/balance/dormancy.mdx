# Dormancy

We panic when we are not producing. If we have writer's block or a slow month, we feel worthless. We think we are broken machines.

A bear in winter is not "broken"; it is smart. **Nature does not hustle 24/7.** A seed that tries to sprout in January dies. Rest is not the opposite of work; it is the fuel for it.

Respect the cave. When the winter comes, sleep. Gather your fat. Trust that the spring always returns, and you will be ready to hunt when it does.
