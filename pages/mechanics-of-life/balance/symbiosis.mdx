# Symbiosis

We are taught to be independent. "I can do it myself." We see life as a competition where we have to beat others to win.

In the forest, nothing survives alone. The fungi feed the trees. The trees shade the fungi. They are partners. This is **Symbiosis** (living together).

We should stop trying to be the lone wolf. We need to ask: "How can I help the people around me win?" When we make our friends and partners stronger, they make us stronger. We should build a web of safety where everyone helps everyone else.
