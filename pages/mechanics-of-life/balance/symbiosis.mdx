# Symbiosis

Society teaches us to be the "lone wolf." We think asking for help is weakness. We want to be the hero who saves the day alone.

In the forest, the lone tree falls. **Independence is a myth.** The fungus feeds the root, and the root feeds the fungus. If you are not part of a web, you are prey. The lone wolf starves.

Kill the ego. Stop trying to win alone. Ask, "How can I feed you so you can feed me?" Build a fortress of friends.
