Why do we feel sick, sad, or angry? We look for deep psychological reasons. We treat our mind like a mystery box.

We are just a meat engine. **If you pour sand in the gas tank, the car won't run.** If you eat trash, watch murder, and listen to idiots, you will produce garbage. You are what you eat. If you consume poison, you will become toxic.

Become the bouncer at the door of your mind. Check IDs. Don't let the poison in. Starve the negative and feed the true.
