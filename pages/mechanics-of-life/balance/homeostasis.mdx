# Homeostasis

We think change is easy. We decide to go on a diet or wake up early, and we are shocked when our body screams "No!" We think we are weak.

The body is a thermostat. Its only job is to stay the same. **Your biology is an anchor.** If you try to sail away, it will drag you back to the harbor of "normal." It is not sabotage; it is safety.

Expect the backlash. Know that when you push, the body pushes back. Don't sprint into a new life; nudge the thermostat one degree at a time until the cold feels normal.
