# Homeostasis

We think change is easy. We decide to go on a diet or wake up early, and we are shocked when our body screams "No!" We think we are weak.

The body is a thermostat. Its only job is to stay the same. **Your biology is an anchor.** If you try to sprint into a new life, your body will snap you back like a rubber band. You won't just fail; you will crash and burn.

Expect the backlash. Know that when you push, the body pushes back. Don't sprint into a new life; nudge the thermostat one degree at a time until the cold feels normal.
