# Homeostasis

We work until we crash. We push and push until we get sick. Then we recover, and we do it again. We live in a cycle of "Boom and Bust."

Your body hates this. Your body wants **Balance**. If you get too hot, you sweat. If you get too cold, you shiver. This is called Homeostasis. Your body is always fighting to stay in the safe zone.

We need to stop fighting our own biology. We should build "Cooling Systems" into our lives. We should schedule rest *before* we are tired. We need to realize that rest is not a reward for working; it is the fuel for working.

  **The Mirror**
  Physics says things fall apart (**Entropy**).
  Biology says we must fight to hold them together (**Homeostasis**).
