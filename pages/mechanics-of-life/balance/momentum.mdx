# Momentum

We think the hardest part is the middle. We worry about endurance. But the hardest part is always the first inch.

**A rocket uses half its fuel just to leave the ground.** Once it is in space, it can fly forever on a whisper. A heavy train is impossible to stop once it is rolling. The magic is in the motion.

Never come to a full stop. Even on your worst days, nudge the wheel. Keep the beast moving, because starting over is expensive.
