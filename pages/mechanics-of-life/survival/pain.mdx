# Pain

We treat pain like an intruder. We drug it, distract it, and hide from it. We think a good life is a numb life.

Pain is the only honest friend we have. **It is the only voice that refuses to lie to us.** It tells us exactly where the fire is. It screams to save our life.

Stop shooting the messenger. Sit with the hurt. Ask, "What are you trying to teach me?" Listen to the scream.
