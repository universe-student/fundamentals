# Pain

We treat pain like an intruder. We drug it, distract it, and hide from it. We think a good life is a numb life.

Pain is the only honest friend we have. **It is the only voice that refuses to lie to us.** It screams to save our life. If you silence the alarm, you don't stop the fire; you just burn down in your sleep.

Stop shooting the messenger. Sit with the hurt. Ask, "What are you trying to teach me?" Listen to the scream.
