# Selection

We want to do everything. We have ten great ideas. We want to please everyone. We fear saying "no."

But nature is a tough editor. There isn't enough food or space for every seed to grow. The universe selects what works and throws away what doesn't. If we try to keep everything alive, everything dies.

We need to be the editor of our own lives. We should look at our projects. Which ones are growing? Which ones are dead? We must be brave enough to cut the dead branches. It hurts, but it saves the tree.
