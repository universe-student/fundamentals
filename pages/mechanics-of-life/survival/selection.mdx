# Selection

We think everyone can be saved. We think every idea is good. We want to keep all our options open.

Nature is a sniper. It produces a thousand seeds, and only one becomes a tree. **Greatness requires a massacre.** You cannot have a beautiful garden if you never prune the weak branches.

Pick up the scissors. Cut the bad habits, the fake friends, and the mediocre projects. Choose the few to save the whole.
