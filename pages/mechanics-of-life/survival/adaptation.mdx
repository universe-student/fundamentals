# Adaptation

We like comfort. We like knowing exactly how things work. When the rules change—when a new technology comes out or the market shifts—we feel threatened. We want to hold on to the "old way."

But nature is clear: **Change or die.** The world does not care about our "old way." The environment is always moving. The dinosaur didn't do anything wrong; the weather just changed, and it couldn't keep up.

So, we shouldn't fall in love with our methods; we should fall in love with our survival. We need to stay light on our feet. When the music changes, we must change our dance steps. We should be proud to change our minds because it means we are still learning.
