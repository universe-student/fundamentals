# Adaptation

We love our routines. We want the world to stay exactly how it was in 2019. When the rules change, we cross our arms and pout.

Nature is cruel to the stubborn. **The dinosaur didn't do anything wrong; the weather just changed.** Evolution does not care about your "legacy." Adapt or die.

Don't fall in love with your methods. Date them. When the music changes, change the dance steps immediately. Stay light on your feet.
