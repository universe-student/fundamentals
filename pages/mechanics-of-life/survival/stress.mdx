# Stress

We dream of a hammock on a beach. We want zero stress. We think comfort is the prize.

**Comfort is a slow death.** Without gravity, bones dissolve. Without wind, trees have weak roots. A life without stress produces a fragile human who breaks at the first touch. If you avoid the weight, you become too weak to carry your own life.

Seek the heavy weight. Choose your burden. Stress the muscle so it tears and grows back thicker. Don't want it easy; want to be strong.
