# Energy

We count hours. We say, "I worked 8 hours." We think time is the currency of work.

A dead phone cannot make a call, no matter how long you hold it. **A tired hour is a waste of life.** One hour of high voltage is worth ten hours of low-power drudgery.

Stop managing time and start managing the battery. Protect your sleep and your peace like a dragon protects gold. When you are empty, stop.
